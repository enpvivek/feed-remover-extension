# Feed Remover
Do you find yourself endlessly scrolling through Facebook and YouTube feeds? I have a solution for you. Create your own browser extension in just 5 easy steps.

With this approach:

- You can easily remove any unwanted elements from any webpage.
- You won't grant external extensions unlimited access to your browsing data.
- It takes only five minutes to set up

## Why?
I wanted to eliminate the intrusive feeds on YouTube and Facebook. However, I was reluctant to install third-party extensions, as many require broad permissions that grant them access to all the websites I visit. It took me five minutes to setup, so you should be done in six.
